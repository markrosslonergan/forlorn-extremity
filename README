Needs ROOT and GSL


So this uses successive runs to do each bit. I have split it into three
sections so we dont have to keep reruning. Each section requires the previous
one to be run first. Should give errors


these three commands

cd build
cmake ..
make

should compile inflight into build/src



To generate the events, 

./inflight --mass Msterile --zprime Mzprime --number NumEvents --mode "gen"

will create a root file with appropiate events,



the analysis, going from RAW mc data to actual bined things
./inflight --mass Msterile --zprime Mzprime --number NumEvents --mode "ana"


and to do the stats and fot everything with bounds and such
./inflight --mass Msterile --zprime Mzprime --number NumEvents --mode "stat"
